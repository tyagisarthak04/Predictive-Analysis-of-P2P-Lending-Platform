# Predictive-Analysis-of-P2P-Lending-Platform

# Overview
This project focuses on performing a comprehensive case study and predictive analysis on the financial risk and risk of default in peer-to-peer (P2P) lending, with data sourced from Bondora, a leading European P2P lending platform. The primary goal is to minimize the financial risks between lenders and borrowers by understanding the variables that influence loan defaults and developing a credit risk model.

# Data Link
The data required for preprocessing, cleaning, and labeling tasks can be downloaded from the following Google Drive link:


Please ensure to download and access the data before proceeding with the tasks.

# Project Structure
The project is divided into several key phases:

# Case Study on Financial Risk and Risk of Default:

An in-depth theoretical analysis of the financial risks and default risks in the P2P lending industry.
Examination of risk factors, real-world default cases, and mitigation strategies.

# Data Exploration and Preprocessing:

Initial data exploration to understand the structure and characteristics of the dataset.
Data cleaning and preparation to ensure high-quality inputs for analysis and modeling.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis to identify patterns and relationships between variables and loan defaults.
Visualization of key insights to aid in understanding the dataset.

# Predictive Modeling:

Development of a credit risk model to predict the likelihood of loan defaults.
Evaluation of the model's performance and optimization for better accuracy.

# Risk Mitigation Recommendations:

Providing actionable insights and strategies to reduce financial risks in P2P lending.

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project has been sourced from Bondora, covering a period between 1st March 2009 and 27th January 2020. It includes demographic and financial information of borrowers, as well as loan transactions, both defaulted and non-defaulted.

# Key Variables:
Loan ID: Unique identifier for each loan.
Loan Amount: The amount of money borrowed.
Interest Rate: The rate of interest charged on the loan.
Loan Duration: The duration over which the loan is to be repaid.
Borrowerâ€™s Demographic Details: Age, gender, income, etc.
Loan Status: The status of the loan (defaulted, repaid, ongoing, etc.).
